# Monte Carlo Simulation for Traffic Light Evaluation

This repository is a fork of [Robert Gembe's](https://www.kaggle.com/code/robertgembe/monte-carlo-simulation) Monte Carlo simulation project, which evaluates the effectiveness of traditional and smart traffic lights.

## Quotation

> **Monte Carlo simulation** is a computational technique that uses random sampling and statistical analysis to model and analyze complex systems or processes. It is named after the famous Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, known for its games of chance.
>
> In the context of evaluating the effectiveness between traditional traffic lights and smart traffic lights, Monte Carlo simulation can be used to simulate various traffic scenarios and assess the performance of each system. Here's how it works:

## Overview
This project uses Monte Carlo simulation to compare the impact of traditional and smart traffic lights on traffic flow. By simulating different traffic scenarios, we can assess the performance of each system and analyze their effectiveness.

## Install Dependences
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
```
